Description of a Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
A Tic-Tac-Toe game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple, interactive web application that allows two players to play the classic game directly in their browser. Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown of how each technology is used in creating the game:

1. HTML (Structure)
Purpose: Provides the basic structure of the game.
Features:
A 3x3 grid for the game board, represented using a div element or a table.
Buttons or text placeholders for each cell in the grid.
An area to display game status (e.g., "Player X's Turn", "Player O Wins").
Optional: Buttons for restarting the game or resetting scores.



2. CSS (Styling)
Purpose: Enhances the visual appearance and layout of the game.
Features:
Styling for the game board (grid layout, border styles, spacing).
Distinct styles for the two players (e.g., X and O) to differentiate their marks.
Highlighting the winning combination with colors or animations.
Responsive design to make the game playable on all devices.


3. JavaScript (Interactivity)
Purpose: Handles the game logic and user interactions.
Features:
Detects player clicks on the grid and alternates between "X" and "O".
Checks for a winning combination (rows, columns, diagonals) or a draw.
Updates the game status dynamically (e.g., "Player O's Turn" or "Player X Wins").
Resets the game when the "Restart" button is clicked.


Features to Enhance
Highlight the winning cells when a player wins.
Add animations for marks (X and O) or transitions when switching turns.
Keep track of scores across multiple games.
Make the game playable against an AI opponent or computer.
This game is a great beginner project to learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation.
